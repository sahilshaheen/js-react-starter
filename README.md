# JS React Starter

JS React starter with Parcel, ESLint, Prettier, Reach Router and Babel (to use class-field syntax). Parcel supports class-field syntax out of the box but it does bug out and the @babel/eslint-parser is required for linting so a separate instance is added for linting (I don't think installing it separately is required as it comes with Parcel as a dep but it's cleaner this way).
